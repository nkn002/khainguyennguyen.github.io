About my name
===
I am originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Here in the States, I go by Nguyen Nguyen, but in Vietnamese, my name is Khải Nguyên [kʰaːj ŋwiəŋ]. As Vietnamese is a tonal and isolating language, many people in the States have found it difficult to pronounce my name. As such, I have enjoyed hearing many variations of my name, such as win, wind, or en-win. Nevertheless, my favorites have been win-win, which is the main motivation for my English name, and Winnie-the-Pooh. Since language changes with time, I believe there is no absolute "correct" way to pronounce any word, so please feel free to call me whatever you want - as long as it makes sense. -->

Hobbies
===
I like puns (evidently), cooking, and playing sports (especially badminton and table tennis).
