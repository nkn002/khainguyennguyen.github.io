I am currently a research associate at Forward Data Lab at UIUC, supervised by Professor [Kevin Chen-chuan Chang](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kcchang). I am also fortunated to be supervised by [Hy Truong Son](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hytruongson/), [Anh Totti Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/research/) and [Thiago Serra](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/thiago-serra). I am interested in applications of NLP, particularly LLMs, in the domains of healthcare and information retrieval. 

Currently, I am researching methods of leveraging LLMs to bridge the semantic gap between complex queries and products. In the healthcare domain, I worked on improving speech summarization with LLM synthetic data ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15888)) and leveraging LLM reasoning to enhance the interpretability and performance of medical sentiment analysis ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21054)). 

In the summer of 2024, I was an intern at the Machine Learning Research team at CodaMetrix where I worked on improving the performance of automated ICD-10 extreme multilabeled classification systems.
