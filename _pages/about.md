I am a CS and Engineering student at Bucknell University at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. I am have done research in multilingual and multimodal NLP as well as the intersection between deep learning and linear programming. I am particularly interested in methods of improving existing models' (1) language understanding and (2) interpretability. My research goal is to allow for human-like behaviors in language models, such as reasoning and code-switching.

Please feel free to contact me via email (nkn002@bucknell.edu).

<!-- About me
===
I am originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Here in the States, I go by Nguyen Nguyen, but in Vietnamese, my name is Khải Nguyên [kʰaːj ŋwiəŋ]. As Vietnamese is a tonal and isolating language, many people in the States have found it difficult to pronounce my name. As such, I have enjoyed hearing many variations of my name, such as win, wind, or en-win. Nevertheless, my favorites have been win-win, which is the main motivation for my English name, and Winnie-the-Pooh. Since language changes with time, I believe there is no absolute "correct" way to pronounce any word, so please feel free to call me whatever you want - as long as it makes sense. -->
